    <h2>Cryptocurrency Background</h2>

    <p>Cryptocurrencies are not new.  Bitcoin was introduced in 2008 as a novel token which could be purchased and sold over a network of servers called a blockchain.  The blockchain has the ability to regect or accept tokens based on an encryption algorithm, and as such if the algorithm is known, new tokens may be created by a hacking technique known as mining.  When first introduced each coin sold for a penny however in 2025 each coin sells forover $105 000.  So, it would seem lucrative to invest in cryptocurencies, but it must be understood that a cryptocurrency is nothing more than an encrypted token; It has no intrinsic value, as Elon Musk showed the world in 2001 when he sold more than a billion dollars worth of the coin triggering a 25% price drop in the instrument.  Since Bitcoin's inception there have been a plethora of new coins offered, often called Meme coins; One such coin called $TRUMP is offered by the American president Donald Trump.</p>
    <p>As of May 20 2025 an Act was put forward to the Senate called the GENIUS Act (Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act).  If passed by the senate it will allow banks to enter the stablecoin market and trade in cryptocurrencies along side the US dollar.  Some provisions set forth by the Act are that the bank must hold stablecoins and dollars in a 1:1 ratio and they must have measures to freeze accounts which are tading in cryptocurrencies nefariously.  Furthermore, holdings of less than 10 billion dollars will be governed by the state and those greater will be governed by a federal regulator such as the, OCC (the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency).  Currently the Act is being hailed as one of the greatest economic achievements in modern age and is said to ensure the strength of the US dollar as the world's reserve currency.</p>
    
    <h2>What is a Blockchain</h2>
    <p>June 11 2025.  By King Edward</p>
    <p>A Blockchain is a piece of software that records a transaction in a linked manner such that each block may be referenced with respect to its latter block.  To keep a record of blocks issued a cryptographic symbol is used to identify members of a common chain and so long as this cryptographic symbol is maintained the chain is said to be valid.  An invalid chain is one in which the cryptographic symbols do not relate.  Blockchains are useful in keeping accurate records of transactions, and when used with digital contracts they may make up the backbone of a marketplace.
