    <h1>Cryptocurrency Regulation</h1>
    <p>Stable coins such as Tether will be institutionalized and used in liu of the American dollar provided security provisions are enforced by states and banks which conform.  The enclosed document outlines the GENIUS Act and how the stable coin industry will be regulated.  Please read the following document prepared by the Congressional Research Service (CRS) which <a href="GeniusAct.pdf">summarizes the ACT</a>.  Further fegulation will be provided by the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act of 2025 (the CLARITY Act).  The CLARITY Act stipulates which commity will oversee the trading of crypto, be it the SEC or the CFTC (the Commodity Futures Trading Commity).  However, as it stands the bill allows crypto exceptions to the rule of governance which will need to be further clarified.  For further information about the CLARITY Act please see, <a href= "https://www.jonesday.com/en/insights/2025/06/congress-introduces-clarity-act-to-establish-digital-asset-regulatory-framework">CLARITY Act</a>.</p>
