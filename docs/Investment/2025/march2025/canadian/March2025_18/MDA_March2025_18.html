<h1 class="western">Introduction</h1>
<p>The markets today are in turmoil.  Tariffs and wars are wreaking
havoc on the lives of hundreds of millions of people in the west.  In
Canada, American tariffs have all but stunted our economy and all
sectors but the precious metals sector is felling it.  So it was
important to filter out short term investments that could be held for
less than 10 days and return from 5% to 10% gains over the period. 
The csv file<a href = "ALL_CAPS_Ranked_tickers_2025-03-18 16-42-13.csv"
> included with this document</a> may be used to determine the
current best and next best investment if used correctly.  For
instance, the <b>new</b> Ranking system is for companies with a
positive SLOPE20 to SLOPE ratio and a negative Z_SCORE (the SLOPE20
being the most recent 20 day price slope the SLOPE being a 60 day
price slope and the Z_SCORE being the deviation from the price index
for a company) producing a list of viable investments that trade-off
between price and strength.  Furthermore, included in the ranking is
the 10%OPPS, which is a measure of the number of times in a 10 day
span over the course of 60 days a company traded for more than 10%
gains.  It is the purpose of the Ranking system to find large short
term value in the markets.  Although no ranking system is perfect,
with a little insight, solid decisions can be made.</p>
<h1 class="western">Environment</h1>
<p>The current economic environment in Canada is bleak. Donald Trump
has imposed tariffs on Canada and has therefor increased the price of
Canadian goods in America. This has spawned a trade war between the
two countries and sparked negative sentiments by the people in both
nations. Buying Canadian goods in Canada is openly promoted by the
media and the same is true (to buy American goods) in America. This
mentality will only have a further negative effect on Canada, which
is non more evident that the effect it has had on corporations such
as SHOP.TO which deals mainly in internet marketing and should not
feel the effects of the tariffs too much, however, its price has
plummeted in recent weeks like most other Canadian stocks.</p>
<h1 class="western">Discussion</h1>
<h3 class="western"><font face="Liberation Sans, sans-serif"><font size="5" style="font-size: 16pt"><b>Pool
of Companies</b></font></font>:</h3>
<p>Although the markets have taken a downturn in recent weeks there
is still hope on the horizon for some interesting investments in
companies like these.  They are companies which are listed on the
Toronto Stock Exchange, have positive earnings and trade more than 1
million dollars in market cap per day.  From this pool of 99
companies it is hoped that at least two a week will be selected for
investment, however, today there were none.</p>
<h3 class="western">Future Work</h3>
<p>Starting tomorrow each of the 99 companies will be assessed for
their merit as a good investment.</p>
<h1 class="western">Conclusion</h1>
<p>There are currently no viable investments to be made as the
Z_Scores of each company with a positive 20 day trading slope are all
too high, recall a viable trade value for the Z_Score is less than
-1.65.
