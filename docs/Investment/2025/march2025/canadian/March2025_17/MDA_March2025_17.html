<h1 class="western">Introduction</h1>
<p>The markets today are in turmoil.  Tariffs and wars are wreaking
havoc on the lives of hundreds of millions of people in the west.  In
Canada, American tariffs have all but stunted our economy and all
sectors but the precious metals sector is felling it.  So it was
important to filter out short term investments that could be held for
less than 10 days and return from 5% to 10% gains over the period. 
The csv file <a href = "500M_sorted_tickers_2025-03-17 15-39-03.csv">
included with this document</a> may be used to determine the
current best and next best investment if used correctly.  For
instance, the <b>new</b> Ranking system is for companies with a
positive SLOPE20 to SLOPE ratio and a negative Z_SCORE (the SLOPE20
being the most recent 20 day price slope the SLOPE being a 60 day
price slope and the Z_SCORE being the deviation from the price index
for a company) producing a list of viable investments that trade-off
between price and strength.  Furthermore, included in the ranking is
the 10%OPPS, which is a measure of the number of times in a 7 day
span over the course of 60 days a company traded for more than 10%
gains.  It is the purpose of the Ranking system to find large short
term value in the markets.  Although no ranking system is perfect,
with a little insight, solid decisions can be made.</p>
<h1 class="western">Environment</h1>
<p>The current economic environment in Canada is bleak. Donald Trump
has imposed tariffs on Canada and has therefor increased the price of
Canadian goods in America. This has spawned a trade war between the
two countries and sparked negative sentiments by the people in both
nations. Buying Canadian goods in Canada is openly promoted by the
media and the same is true (to buy American goods) in America. This
mentality will only have a further negative effect on Canada, which
is non more evident that the effect it has had on corporations such
as SHOP.TO which deals mainly in internet marketing and should not
feel the effects of the tariffs too much, however, its price has
plummeted in recent weeks like most other Canadian stocks.</p>
<h1 class="western">Discussion</h1>
<h2 class="western">Companies to watch:</h2>
<p>Although the markets have taken a downturn in recent weeks there
is still hope on the horizon for some interesting investments in
companies like ELF.TO, LUG.TO and GWO.TO.  E-L Financial Corporation
Limited (ELF.TO) trades with a small volume but possess a very strong
EPS and a low Price/Earnings ratio.  For a short term investment of
about $5000 ELF.TO is a good bet because it lends itself well to a
10% trade.  Lundin Gold Inc. (LUG.TO) is another company to watch due
to its 5 year return which is well over 300% it has strong earnings
per share and a healthy PE ratio (Price to Earnings Ratio), it also
lends itself well to a 10% trade.  Lastly there is Great-West Lifeco
Inc. (GWO.TO) showing more than 100% gains in the last 5 years strong
earnings per share and a healthy price to earnings ratio.  Each one
of these companies, with the exception of ELF.TO which has a very
small trade volume, will make a wonderful future investment offering
high gains and security.</p>
<h2 class="western">Top Ranked Companies to Avoid:</h2>
<p>Rounding out the top five ranked companies today are four to be
avoided.  Although their price is low they are struggling financially
and as a result their prices could fall further.  These companies are
TRLY.TO, BITF.TO, DND.TO and CURA.TO.  The first two companies are trading at
a fraction of their 5 year highs and have negative earnings
furthermore they are both trading at a 52 week low which means
further lows may come.  DND.TO, however, suffers from the same woes
as  TRLY.TO and BITF.TO but it has a flat 5 year price profile making
it the best investment of the three but still woefully bad. And Curaleaf
Holdings, Inc.(CURA.TO) has a horrendous 5 year return losing
approximately 90% of its value, furthermore it has negative earnings
making it the poorest of choices for an investment.</p>
<h2 class="western">Top Ranking Picks</h2>
<p>From the list of ranked companies three companies in the top five
lend themselves for a special mention however, their price low was
not met for an investment of 10% and so they will be discussed solely
on the merit of their corporate strength, they were;  Curaleaf
Holdings, Inc.(CURA.TO), Energy Fuels Inc.(EFR.TO), Denison Mines
Corp. (DML.TO) and Pet Value Holdings Ltd. (PET.TO).  Energy Fuels
Inc.(EFR.TO) has negative earnings which is alarming but constant
5year value which is comforting,  Although it did not meet the
Z_SCORE price point it should make for a comfortable future
investment.  Denison Mines Corp. (DML.TO) is the next company on the
list.  It has small negative earnings which is not uncommon for a
mining company but it has a strong 5 year return (roughly 400%) 
although it did not hit its price point last week it is a company to
watch.  And the other company is Pet Value Holdings Ltd. (PET.TO). 
Although PET.TO has a stale 5 year return it has strong earnings and
a healthy PE ratio this company may have found its bottom and if
given the proper Z_SCORE should make a good investment and might even
yield 10%.</p>
<h1 class="western">Conclusion</h1>
<p>There are currently no viable investments to be made as the
Z_Scores of each company with a positive 20 day trading slope are all
too high, recall a viable trade value for the Z_Score is less than
-1.65.  However, due to their strength during the recent market
downturn companies to watch are:</p>
