<h1 class="western">Introduction</h1>
<p><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">As of Thursday March 13
2025 there is not much to relay in terms of short term stock picks. 
As the <a href="sorted_tickers_2025-03-13 20-14-39.csv">Ranking</a>
 system shows, in the top three picks, only SLF.TO
shows any promise and it is still too early to make a final judgment.
 When reading the table two numbers should stand out, SLOPE20 and
Z_SCORE.  SLOPE20 is the 20 day slope of the stock and Z_SCORE is the
deviation of the price of the stock from the stock index.  A positive
SLOPE20 and a Z_SCORE less than -1.65 are indicative of a good short
term investment.  Finally the, #10%OPPS tells how many opportunities
over a seven day span throughout 60 trading days, the stock could
have been sold for 10% or more (the higher this value the greater the
possibility of making 10% on a trade).</font></p>

<h1 class="western">Environment</h1>
<p><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">The current economic
environment in Canada is bleak.  Donald Trump has imposed tariffs on
Canada and has therefor increased the price of Canadian goods in
America.  This has spawned a trade war between the two countries and
sparked negative sentiments by the people in both nations.  Buying
Canadian goods in Canada is openly promoted by the media and the same
is true (to buy American goods) in America.  This mentality will only
have a further negative effect on Canada, which is non more evident
that the effect it has had on corporations such as SHOP.TO which
deals mainly in internet marketing and should not feel the effects of
the tariffs too much, however, its price has plummeted in recent
weeks like most other Canadian stocks.  </font>

<h1 class="western">Conclusion</h1>
<p><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">The current Canadian
situation leaves an investor to think that there really are no good
investments in Canada at the moment.  According to the screener
downloadable <a href="sorted_tickers_2025-03-13_12-32-35.csv">here</a>, 
Sun Life Financial (SLF.TO) is the best choice but
it is likely that the payoff for a short term investment in SLF.TO
will be low (less that 2%).  It is wise then to keep out of the
markets for the time being and wait for a golden opportunity â€“ they
will happen.</font></p>
