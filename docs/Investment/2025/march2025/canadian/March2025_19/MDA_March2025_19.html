Edwardâ€™s Investments</b></font></font></p>
<h1 class="western">Introduction</h1>
<p>The markets today are in turmoil.  Tariffs and wars are wreaking
havoc on the lives of hundreds of millions of people in the west.  In
Canada, American tariffs have all but stunted our economy and all
sectors but the precious metals sector is felling it.  So it was
important to filter out short term investments that could be held for
less than 10 days and return from 5% to 10% gains over the period. 
The csv file <a href = "ALL_CAPS_Ranked_tickers_2025-03-19_14-28-46.csv"> 
included with this document</a> may be used
to determine the current best and next best investment if used
correctly.  For instance, the <b>new</b> Ranking system is for
companies with a positive SLOPE20 to SLOPE ratio and a negative
Z_SCORE (the SLOPE20 being the most recent 20 day price slope the
SLOPE being a 60 day price slope and the Z_SCORE being the deviation
from the price index for a company) producing a list of viable
investments that trade-off between price and strength.  Furthermore,
included in the ranking is the 10%OPPS, which is a measure of the
number of times in a 10 day span over the course of 60 days a company
traded for more than 10% gains.  It is the purpose of the Ranking
system to find large short term value in the markets.  Although no
ranking system is perfect, with a little insight, solid decisions can
be made.</p>
<h1 class="western">Discussion</h1>
<h2 class="western"><font face="Liberation Sans, sans-serif"><font size="5" style="font-size: 16pt"><b>Pool
of Companies</b></font></font>:</h2>
<p>Although the markets have taken a downturn in recent weeks there
is still hope on the horizon for some interesting investments in
companies  They are companies which are listed on the Toronto Stock
Exchange, have positive earnings and trade more than 1 million
dollars in market cap per day.  From this pool of 100 companies it is
hoped that at least two a week will be selected for investment,
however, today there were none.</p>
<h1 class="western">Conclusion</h1>
<p>There are currently no viable investments to be made as the
Z_Scores of each company with a positive 20 day trading slope are all
too high, recall a viable trade value for the Z_Score is less than
-1.65.
